    "Cody was born in Iran in 1956.[3] Her father owned a boy's high school, where she would teach during the summer.[3][5] Her three brothers became engineers, while her sister became a dentist.[5][6] In 1978, Cody completed a Bachelor of Science degree in structural engineering at Aryamehr University of Technology (now called Sharif University of Technology).[5][7][6]\n",

    "Cody left Iran for Canada in 1979 with $2,000. At this point, her brother had completed a Bachelor's of Engineering at Concordia University in Montreal, and arranged for her to meet with the engineering professor Cedric Marsh.[5] Through this meeting, Cody received a scholarship in engineering to attend Concordia University in Montreal, where she completed a master's degree in engineering in 1981.[3][5]\n",

      "Okay, so I need to explain Newton's second law of motion. Hmm, where do I start? I remember from school that it has something to do with force and acceleration. Let me try to recall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Newton's second law is one of the three laws Sir Isaac Newton came up with. The first was about inertia, right? That an object stays at rest or moves in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. The third law is about action and reaction pairs. So the second law must be about how forces affect motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's something like force equals mass times acceleration, yeah F=ma. But wait, what does each part mean? Mass is like the amount of matter in an object, so a heavy object has more mass than a light one. Acceleration is how fast the velocity changes over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if you have a big mass and apply a certain force, it won't accelerate as much as a smaller mass with the same force. That makes sense because heavier objects are harder to move or stop once moving. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but sometimes people get confused between mass and weight. Mass is constant regardless of location, whereas weight depends on gravity. So Newton's second law applies to both, I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think about an example. If you push a shopping cart with a certain force, it accelerates. If you push something heavier, like a piano, the same force won't make it accelerate as much. That fits F=ma because the mass of the piano is greater than that of the cart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, if you have two objects and apply the same force to both, the lighter one will accelerate more. So acceleration is inversely proportional to mass when force is constant. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing: acceleration depends on the net force applied. If multiple forces are acting on an object, only the resultant (or net) force affects the acceleration. So F in the equation is actually the sum of all external forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh right, units too. In the metric system, the Newton is the unit for force. It's equal to kg·m/s² because mass is in kilograms and acceleration is m/s².\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, sometimes people mix up Newton's second law with others. Like, Newton's first is about inertia, third is action-reaction. So yeah, the second one specifically deals with how forces cause acceleration.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also mention that this law applies to all objects as long as we consider the net force and neglect any friction or air resistance unless specified. In real life, those factors can complicate things a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together: Newton's second law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force applied and inversely proportional to its mass. The equation F=ma encapsulates this relationship, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "Newton's second law of motion is a fundamental principle in physics that describes the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. Here's a structured explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Statement**: Newton's second law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This can be mathematically expressed as F = ma, where:\n",
      "   - \\( F \\) represents the net force applied (in Newtons, N),\n",
      "   - \\( m \\) is the mass of the object (in kilograms, kg),\n",
      "   - \\( a \\) is the acceleration produced (in meters per second squared, m/s²).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Key Concepts**:\n",
      "   - **Force**: The external push or pull that causes an object to change its velocity. It can be a single force or the vector sum of multiple forces.\n",
      "   - **Mass**: The amount of matter in an object, measured in kilograms. Mass is constant and independent of location.\n",
      "   - **Acceleration**: The rate at which the velocity of an object changes over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Implications**:\n",
      "   - For a given force, lighter objects accelerate more than heavier ones. This explains why a piano accelerates less with the same push compared to a shopping cart.\n",
      "   - Acceleration is influenced by all external forces acting on an object; thus, net force determines acceleration, not just one force.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Examples**:\n",
      "   - Pushing a light cart versus a heavy one demonstrates how mass affects acceleration for the same applied force.\n",
      "   - In sports, players use force and understanding of mass to control acceleration when throwing or kicking objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Units**: The Newton (N) is the unit of force in the metric system, equivalent to kg·m/s².\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Considerations**: While F = ma is straightforward, real-world applications may require considering additional factors like friction or air resistance unless specified.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Newton's second law succinctly explains how net force and mass determine acceleration, with F = ma being the mathematical expression of this relationship.\n"
